# 🧠 Agents

A collection of AI agentic workflows and prototypes built using LLMs, tools, and planning strategies.  
Each subfolder contains an isolated example demonstrating a specific concept or use case.

---

## 📁 Structure

Each numbered folder contains a self-contained project:

| # | Example | Description |
|--:|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Wikipedia and Math](./1_Wikipedia_and_Math/README.md) | Simple retrieval and parsing agent that looks up Wikipedia and performs math operations based on the content |
| 2 | [Name](./2_Name/README.md) | description |
| 3 | *(Planned)* | Coming soon... |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Agents.git
   cd Agents
   ```

2. **Enter the folder for the example you want to run**
   ```bash
   cd 1_Wikipedia_and_Math
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions in that folder's `README.md`**

## 📦 Dependencies

Each example has its own dependencies listed in its folder (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).  
You can create separate virtual environments per project, or unify them into one if they share libraries.

## 🧰 Tools & Frameworks

- OpenAI / Google
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) / LlamaIndex
- Python ≥ 3.10

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- ✅ Add first working agent (Wikipedia + Math)
- 🛠️ Build agents using tools + memory
- 🧭 Implement planner + executor loop
- 🤖 Multi-agent collaboration example
- 📊 Integrate agents with external APIs (e.g., YouTube, Jira, Notion, CRM)

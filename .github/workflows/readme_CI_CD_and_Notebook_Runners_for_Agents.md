# Automating Agents: CI/CD and Notebook Runners

You're doing great! When I said:

> ‚ÄúAdd CI/CD or notebook runners for each agent‚Äù

I was suggesting ways to **automate testing, execution, or validation** of each agentic project inside your `Agents` repo. Let me explain both parts:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)

### üí° What It Means
Set up GitHub Actions (or another CI tool) to automatically:
- Run tests when you push code
- Validate your code runs without errors (e.g., importing models, downloading data, etc.)
- Optionally deploy artifacts (like PDFs, logs, docs) or host something

### üß† Why It's Useful
- Ensures nothing is broken after each commit
- Encourages reproducibility & automation
- Makes it easier to demo or scale your agents later

### üõ†Ô∏è Example: GitHub Actions
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-agent.yml
name: Test Agents

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '1_Wikipedia_and_Math/**'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '1_Wikipedia_and_Math/**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run Agent
        run: python 1_Wikipedia_and_Math/agent.py
```

## ‚úÖ 2. Notebook Runners

### üí° What It Means
Automate execution of `.ipynb` notebooks using tools like:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `nbconvert` / `nbmake` | Runs notebooks and fails on exceptions |
| `papermill`            | Runs notebooks with different parameters |
| `jupytext`             | Pairs `.py` + `.ipynb` versions cleanly |

### üß† Why It's Useful
- Verifies that notebooks don‚Äôt break over time
- Allows reproducible experiments
- Great for sharing results or demos

---

## üß© Combining Both
You can write a GitHub Action to automatically run notebooks or agents in each project folder.

Example:
```yaml
- name: Run notebook
  run: jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute 1_Wikipedia_and_Math/demo.ipynb
```

## Summary Table

| Feature       | Description                                      | Value for You                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **CI/CD**     | Auto-runs scripts/tests on push/PR               | Validates each agent project automatically   |
| **Notebook runner** | Auto-executes `.ipynb` files              | Ensures notebooks stay reproducible          |
| **GitHub Actions** | Platform to host both                      | Free, flexible, works seamlessly with GitHub |

Let me know if you'd like a working GitHub Action YAML file set up for one of your projects ‚Äî I‚Äôll generate and explain it line by line.
